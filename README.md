# HTML & CSS Course
This is a **free** course for learning both the HTML and CSS programming languages. It teaches the basics of both languages, how to use them, and provides interactive checks that test your skills.

## What is HTML?

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is code to build the layout and structure of a webpage. HTML uses elements which are parts of the website with special properties and the ability to contain other element. Elements are written using tags like `<span id="example">this</span>` which contain the type of element (span), the text/other elements inside it ("this"), and properties that modify the behavior of the element (id="example").

## What is CSS?

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a programming language used to stylize your HTML document, such as formatting text, positioning elements, and even creating animations. CSS uses "rules" to affect specific elements. For example, the rule `* { color: red }` would change every element to be the color <span style="color:red">red.</span>
