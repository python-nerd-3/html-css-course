# 1.1.5 Links

This will be the first time we will using attributes of elements. 

## Links to other websites using \<a>

You can create links to other websites using the \<a> tag and href attribute. An example of a link here: `<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3Z7zEc7AXQ">`. This links to a pretty cool website you should see it. Anyways, the href attribute specifies the link of where you want to go to. The a stands for anchor and is always used for links. You **always** have to paste in the full URL of a website including the https://. This is how the browser knows you are actually linking to a third party website.

If you want to create a link to somewhere that is inside your files but you are not sure where it will be, there are four different methods to point to a file:

- File in the same folder: "example.html"
- File inside of a folder inside of the current folder: "exampleFolder/example.html"
- File inside of the root directory: "/example.html"
- File in the parent directory of the current folder: "../example.html"

These can be combined to create a specific path to reach any file. For more detail, go to [this W3Schools article.](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_filepaths.asp)

**IMPORTANT: You can not link to other files/folders with spaces in their name. This is why all of the files/folders have a 1 word name except for the lesson texts because nothing needs to link to them.**
